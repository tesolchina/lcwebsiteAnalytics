update from AI here ... 


ok this looks great-/Users/simonwang/Documents/GitHub/lcwebsiteAnalytics/prototype_proposal/incremental_demo.html

but we still hope the changes are made upon /Users/simonwang/Documents/GitHub/lcwebsiteAnalytics/LCmain/lc_main_page_20250906_074151.html

we can push this over to https://github.com/tesolchina/smartLessons/ later

=========

I can see the new demo

but what we need is not a complete revamp but some adjustment to the existing page 

so let's make one small change at a time 

how about adding the corporate video as a YouTube embed 

https://youtu.be/I_rnNtX73sA?si=EO6qtsRjE8Km32zj use this as an example 

the video player should occupy half of the space on the left

on the right there should be a photo of LC head with a short message linking to long message to a separate page 

you may crawl https://lc.hkbu.edu.hk/main/lconference/ to get Cissy's photo 

let's use a toggle to hide the PDF posters
