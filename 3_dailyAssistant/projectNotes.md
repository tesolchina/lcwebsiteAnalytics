Currently we are trying to revamp the LC website https://lc.hkbu.edu.hk/main/
We have a new UAT which is only accessble on campus https://uat-lc.hkbu.edu.hk/courses/chinese.html
or via VPN


I hope you can see there are three things going on here 

- the new website currently UAT- I have not done much on it but some old html files are here
- current redesign of the LC main front page
- I wrote notes for you to update and do things and draft email

I hope we can reorganise the directory so these three things are separate - the third component let's call it dailyAssistant should be a separate folder which I can export to other contexts 

========

Simon's note for AI- do not edit; could reformat

let's propose some quick fix

the current carousal posters are messy and overwhelming we should remove them and put them in toggles

meanwhile we should add our LC corporate video to the front page as well as a short message the LC head with her photo https://lc.hkbu.edu.hk/main/lconference/

AI: can you draft a proposal and a prototype - we can host it in smartlessons.hkbu.tech/lc/demo.index we need to later push the page to https://github.com/tesolchina/smartLessons/

ok this looks great-/Users/simonwang/Documents/GitHub/lcwebsiteAnalytics/prototype_proposal/incremental_demo.html 

but we still hope the changes are made upon /Users/simonwang/Documents/GitHub/lcwebsiteAnalytics/LCmain/lc_main_page_20250906_074151.html
